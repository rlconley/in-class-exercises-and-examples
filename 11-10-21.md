## Copying a repository (repo) from GitHub - Fork method for examples

### Note this is different from how you will do homework and collaborations because you want to keep your own personal version of this file with your work in it.

1. In iTerm, make sure you are the in the directory where you want to keep classwork.
2. Visit the url for the repository https://github.com/Momentum-PT-Team-3/in-class-exercises-and-examples and click the `fork` button. Choose to fork the repo to your own GitHub account and copy the url from the forked repo.
3. In iTerm, run `git clone <url> .` The `.` is important, it means "in this folder, don't make a new folder." When you see `<>`, that is a placeholder and everything inside it as well as the `<>` will be replaced.
4. Use `code .` to open the contents of the folder with VS Code

- rename the `ex_turtle_draw.py` to `turtle_draw.py`. We will follow this procedure for the examples we work on in class so you have your own version of each file
